<h1>FAQ's</h1>
<img src="Downloads/confused panda.jpeg">
<h2 style="color:mediumpurple">How does COVID-19 spread?</h2>
<h4>SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread from person to person through droplets produced
    during coughing or breathing during close contact with an infected individual. Infection can also 
    occur through indirect contact when these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the infected 
    individual and the other person touches these objects or surfaces, then touches their eyes, nose or 
    mouth. This is why it is important to stay at least 1-2 meters (3-6 feet) away from a person who is 
    sick. Given that some individuals have no symptoms while still infected with the virus, physical 
    distancing of 1-2 meters should be observed regardless of whether the other person seems sick.
</h4>
<h2 style="color:mediumpurple">What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h2>
<h4 style="color:plum">The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and fatigue. Some patients may have loss of
     taste or smell, conjunctivitis, headache, muscle aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore
      throat, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, and different types of skin rashes. These symptoms are usually
       mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel
        unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special management. 
        Approximately 1 out of every 6 people who get COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops symptoms
         of severe COVID-19, which include difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, confusion, loss of
          appetite, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, and needs hospitalization. Older people and
           those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes are
            more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing 
            should seek medical attention.</h4>
<h2 style="color:mediumpurple">I am well and asymptomatic. Should I use a mask?</h2>
<h4>The WHO advises that masks be used as part of a comprehensive package of control measures to prevent 
    the further spread of COVID-19. Masks alone are not sufficient and should be used together with other
     practices outlined above.
</h4>
<h2 style="color:mediumpurple">What alternatives do I have if there are no hand sanitizers available? Can I use other alcohol like 
    ethyl or liquor?</h2>
<h4 style="color:plum">If hand sanitizers are not available, hand washing with soap and water is recommended. Liquor is not 
    effective against coronavirus. For an alcohol-based hand rub to be effective, it must have a minimum 
    alcohol content of 60%.</h4>
